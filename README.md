PROJECT SUMMARY

You are a data analyst working for an ice cream company. Management is interested in improving the company's ice cream sales.

The company has been collecting data about its sales—but not a lot. The available data is from an internal data source and is based on sales for 2019. You’ve been asked to review the data and provide some insight into the company’s ice cream sales. Ideally, management would like answers to the following questions:

What is the most popular flavor of ice cream?
How does temperature affect sales?
How do weekends affect sales?
